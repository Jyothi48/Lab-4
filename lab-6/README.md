# Banking System Simulation

This is a simple Java console-based banking simulation that allows users to:
- Deposit money into a bank account
- Withdraw money from the account
- Check their current balance
  this program also demonstrates exception handling using:
- Java's built-in exceptions (InputMismatchException, ArithmeticException)
- A custom exception (InsufficientBalanceException) for handling cases when a user tries to withdraw more money than their account balance.
